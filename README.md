Hello everyone, I’m Rajit Singh Purviya, a 3rd-year student at IIT (BHU) Varanasi, pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering. I have a strong passion for competitive programming, data structures, and full-stack development. Lately, I’ve been exploring backend development alongside my work in frontend.
This is a real-time chat application I developed using React and socket.io-client for instant, real-time communication. The app features a responsive design powered by TailwindCSS, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes. I used react-router-dom for efficient navigation and integrated Web Vitals to monitor the app's performance. For testing, I incorporated Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the application is robust. To get started, simply clone the repo, run npm install to install all necessary dependancies  and then npm start to launch the app on http://localhost:3000. This project reflects my focus on building scalable, responsive, and efficient applications.
